The scene should feature a vast, vibrant field of blooming sunflowers facing the sun, grounded by rich green foliage and grass in the foreground. The sky above must be a brilliant, clear azure blue with a bright, glowing sun overhead. Use warm, intense lighting to convey the heat of a summer day. The image should be photorealistic in 8k resolution, utilizing high saturation with vibrant yellows and blues, sharp focus, and an energetic, warm atmosphere.",
